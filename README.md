# Module-19 - Cypress: Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with implementing testing for an exististing application. To do this I added Cypress for component and end-to-end tests. Doing so ensures reliability and robustness through testing.

To accomplish this I completed the following tasks:

1. Install Cypress as a dev dependency

2. Configure Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing

3. Create a component test for the quiz component

4. Create an end-to-test for the quiz component
